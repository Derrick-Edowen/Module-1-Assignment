# Code Refactoring for Horiseon Webpage
Horiseon Webpage - Refactored

## Description
The purpose of this project is to refactor already existing functional code. Through refactoring I was able to organize the code of this webpage to a more legible and cohesive state. I was also able to minimize the prevelance of redundant code. With these changes I demonstrated that the  same output can be obtained  with less/cleaner code. This project will teach others that the same outcome  can be achieved in various ways and that simplicity should be top priority when developing content.

## Installation
To open the project a user just needs to open the index.html file in their browser.
